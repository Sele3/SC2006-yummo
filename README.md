# Rules for collaboration
- `main` branch will be used as the working branch. All new changes done shall not be pushed directly to `main` unless it is a very minor change that will not affect the overall applicaion (e.g adding comments, editing readme file etc)

- How to push new changes to GitHub:
  - Create a new branch with the following name format: 
     - [yourname]/[taskid]_[taskname] 
     - (e.g sayhong/1_create-new-models)
  - Push your changes to the new branch just created
  - On GitHub, create a pull request (PR) to `main`
  - Ask another person working on the same end to review the code and approve the PR
  - Impt: Do **NOT** select the option to delete the branch when merging. These will be used for tracking purposes / backup
  
- How to resolve conflicts: 
  - On your own local repo, merge `main` to your own branch
  - On your own local repo, resolve any conflicts as necessary 
  - Push the changes to your own branch
  - On GitHub, the PR should now display that there are no conflicts
  
- Good commit naming conventions to follow (optional)
  - See: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

# Dependencies
- django
- djangorestframework
- djoser

# Setting up local environment (backend)
`pipenv` is used to manage our dependencies and virtual environment

If you haven't installed pipenv, run the following command 

> pip install pipenv

## Creating a virtual environment
1. Navigate to the folder where the pipfile is located (in Backend folder)
2. Spawn a shell in a virtual environment to isolate the development of this app using the following command

> pipenv shell

This will create a virtual environment if one doesnâ€™t already exist.

## Installing dependencies
Then, run the following command to install the dependencies listed in the pipfile.
> pipenv install

## Installing new packages
To install new packages, simply run the command and replacing `package_name` with the package that you want to install.
> pipenv install `package_name`

# Running the Django Server
Navigate to the Backend folder (where manage.py is located), and run the following command.
> python manage.py runserver

If there are any errors about migration, run these 2 commands then try the previous command

> python manage.py makemigrations

> python manage.py migrate

## Guide on using the Swagger page (Backend)
Majority of the endpoints require token authorization except for the login endpoint and some others. Below are the steps to login directly for backend:

- To login to a Customer/Merchant
  - Scroll to `/auth/token/login/` fill in the fields of the user
  - Copy the token and paste it in the `Authorize` option at the top of the page or the lock symbol beside any of the endpoints
  - Format for the token is "Token [hex code]" (e.g. Token 1b4a....029f)
  
- Alternatively, go to the Django admin page and copy the token of the user

# Setting up local environment (frontend)
Navigate to the yummo folder in Frontend (cd .\Frontend\yummo\), start the server by running
> npm start

If there are errors when starting the server, install missing dependencies by running
> npm install
