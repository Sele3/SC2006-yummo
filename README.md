# Rules for collaboration
- `main` branch will be used as the working branch. All new changes done shall not be pushed directly to `main` unless it is a very minor change that will not affect the overall applicaion (e.g adding comments, editing readme file etc)

- How to push new changes to GitHub:
  - Create a new branch with the following name format: 
     - [yourname]/[taskid]_[taskname] 
     - (e.g sayhong/1_create-new-models)
  - Push your changes to the new branch just created
  - On GitHub, create a pull request (PR) to `main`
  - Ask another person working on the same end to review the code and approve the PR
  - Impt: Do **NOT** select the option to delete the branch when merging. These will be used for tracking purposes / backup
  
- How to resolve conflicts: 
  - On your own local repo, merge `main` to your own branch
  - On your own local repo, resolve any conflicts as necessary 
  - Push the changes to your own branch
  - On GitHub, the PR should now display that there are no conflicts
  
- Good commit naming conventions to follow (optional)
  - See: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
